# Data

## Raw Data

- `clean_combined_gasoline_data.csv` is combined data from the [EIA Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/)
- `clean_gasoline_RBOB_Futures_historical_data.csv` is the historical daily quotes of the RBOB futures contract downloaded form Yahoo Finance. I dorpped the volatility column as it does not have consistent data.
